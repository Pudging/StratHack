# StratHack
# BASIC RUNDOWN OF THE CODE:
# CODE IS FORMATTED AS IS STANDARD FOR THE MAJORITY OF FLASK PROJECTS
# Templates contains HTML/CSS files used for each webpage
# uploads is the folder for user uploaded data onto the webpage
# app.py stores the endpoint logic for flask as well as allk the eneded functions that accompany it.
# pycache files can be ignored - they're basically for bookkeeping, the code generates them to run methods within each of the uploaded files. Pay it no mind if you're not interested in that kind of stuff
# overall the code is pretty simple and intuitive, just make sure you have it all because it does rely on each other.
